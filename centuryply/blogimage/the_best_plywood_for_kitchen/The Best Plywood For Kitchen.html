	However, despite the popularity, not everyone is aware of plywood on entirety. Consumers, at times, tend to get confused about which plywood to choose for what purpose. Worry not! It is not daunting as it may look. Here’s some help for you to pick the best plywood boards for your kitchen.

	The kitchen area is a space that is exposed to a lot of water and moisture on a daily basis. Hence, simply using solid wood for cabinets and other kitchen spaces would not do any good. CenturyPly’s diverse range of plywood is every homeowner’s prime choice because of its high strength and better performance in damp and wet conditions.

<p>
	Here is a list of CenturyPly’s plywood boards that you can use in the kitchen, without worrying about damage or rotting:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>1. BWP Grade or Waterproof Plywood</strong><br />

	<a href="https://www.centuryply.com/plywood/bond-710" target="_blank">BWP grade plywood</a> stands for boiling water proof plywood, which is known to be completely water resistant. As this board can withstand prolonged exposure to water, BWP plywood becomes an obvious choice when you are looking for a suitable plywood for your kitchen.
	Similarly, Marine Grade Plywood is also one of the prime plywood choices, which is being used in both indoor and outdoor spaces. This plywood board is popular among consumers for its superior performance in wet and damp conditions

	<strong> 3. Firewall Plywood</strong><br />

	As the name suggests, it is a fire-resisting non-leachable plywood from the house of CenturyPly that saves you and your belongings in case of fire accident! Firewall plywood, due to its less flammability, low rate of burning, and delayed flame penetration time, provides ‘safety’ and ‘security’ by delaying the fire to spread.
	Mainly, firewall ply is used for both interior and exterior applications, like kitchens, food stalls, hospitals, offices, exhibition stalls, auditoriums, ship interiors, container construction, etc.
