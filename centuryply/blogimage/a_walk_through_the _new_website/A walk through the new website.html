Title: A walk through the new website
<p>
	CenturyPly, since its inception in 1986, has always believed that change is the only constant, and evolution is the key to success. Hence, we constantly strive to deliver the best experience to our customers which is why we have been evolving our range of products and plywood boards to meet the contemporary requirements of the market.
</p>
<p>
	Being the largest <a href="https://www.centuryply.com/brands" target="_blank">plywood brand in India</a>, we enjoy a pan India presence with our dealer network that is present in every major city across the country. It is because of our constant efforts to provide the best products to our customers, that we have become Indiaâ€™s favourite plywood brand. But with changing times, we wanted to re-establish our online presence as well, which would allow us to reach to the millennial generation as well.
</p>
<p>
	With this thought in mind, we decided to revamp our website and give it a new look. But as you know, CenturyPly is much more than just looks. Hence, we have added some features that aim to assist the customers in making the right choice whenever they are looking to buy CenturyPly products.
</p>
<p>
	The new website is more interactive and delivers the desired information with just a few clicks. Packed with all our listings, the new website is made user-friendly which lets you take a plunge into the world of CenturyPly. The highlight of our revamped website is the impressive list of features that have been added to ease out the experience. Take a look at our features:
